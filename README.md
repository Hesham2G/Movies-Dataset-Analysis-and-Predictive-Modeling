### Project Name:
**Movies Dataset Analysis and Predictive Modeling**

### Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing movie details such as release date, vote average, vote count, popularity, budget, and revenue. Using Python and various libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project conducts both descriptive and visual analysis, followed by predictive modeling for predicting budget and vote average.

Key features of the project:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Data inspection: Uses functions like `.info()`, `.head()`, `.describe()` to understand the dataset.
   - Missing and duplicated data analysis using `.isna()` and `.duplicated()`.
   - Distribution analysis: Visualizes movie release patterns based on the day of the week, month, and year.
   - Descriptive statistics for vote averages, vote counts, and popularity.

2. **Visualization**:
   - **Bar plots and pie charts** to represent the distribution of movies released by day of the week and month.
   - **Box plots** for analyzing the distribution of vote averages, vote counts, and popularity.
   - **Correlation heatmap** to explore relationships between numerical features.
   - **Pair plots and joint plots** to identify correlations between various factors such as budget, revenue, and popularity.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - The project builds predictive models using **Random Forest Regressor** to predict:
     - **Budget** based on other features in the dataset.
     - **Vote average** based on other movie attributes.
   - The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **RÂ² score**.

4. **Error Analysis**:
   - The error percentage of the predictions is calculated and compared against the mean values to determine the accuracy of the models.

This project is suitable for those interested in movie data analysis and predictive modeling. It provides an overview of the relationships between various movie attributes and includes practical machine learning applications for regression tasks.
